# AI-Python-Project
This project includes various Python scripts related to AI and computer vision.

Brief Overview of Each Script:
Cat and Dog Detection:
Detects cats and dogs in a given frame. The script can be modified to detect other objects as needed.

Centroid Tracker:
Tracks objects within a frame. It is utilized in the person tracking script to keep track of individuals.

Dwell Time Calculation:
Measures the duration a person remains in a frame, providing insights into total time spent.

Face Detection:
Identifies faces in images or video frames.

FPS Calculation:
Displays the approximate frames per second (FPS) while processing video files or live webcam feeds.

OpenCV Basics:
Demonstrates fundamental operations using OpenCV.

Person Detection in Images:
Detects individuals in still images.

Person Detection in Videos:
Identifies people in video files. A sample test video is included in the project.

Person Tracking:
Detects and tracks individuals in a frame, assigning unique IDs to each detected person.

Social Distance Monitoring:
Analyzes social distancing by measuring the space between individuals. Bounding boxes turn red if the distance falls below a set threshold and green otherwise.

Tracking Line Drawing:
Draws a line to visualize the movement path of a person entering and moving through a frame.

Face Mask Detection:
Determines whether a person is wearing a face mask.

Person Counter:
Counts the number of people present in a frame.
